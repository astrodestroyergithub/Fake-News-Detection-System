[6:10 pm, 07/02/2022] Faculty/Abdul Qadir/VIT: Research Paper Introduction
An introduction is the initial part of a research paper and the part that a reader is likely to read first (at least when focusing deeply and reading it in detail). Hence, definitions, notions, and other information required for understanding the paper are presented/listed here.

Every research paper needs context so that readers can understand why you have created it. This is exactly what you can do in your research paper introduction.  It is essential that you take your time and make sure you get it right.

The introduction of writing is going to set out your rationale, which is what research will be based around. Your readers should be able to tell what they are reading right from the beginning and whether it interests them.

It is essential that you make the beginning of your research paper interesting and engage with your readers from the first line. This will make sure that people continue to read and learn about what you have found out. You should also state a hypothesis and the way you think your work will turn out in conclusion.

[6:18 pm, 07/02/2022] Faculty/Abdul Qadir/VIT: How to write Literature Survey Section


In writing the literature review, your purpose is to convey to your reader what knowledge and ideas have been established on a topic, and what their strengths and weaknesses are. 

As a piece of writing, the literature review must be defined by a guiding concept (e.g., your research objective, the problem or issue you are exploring. It is not just a descriptive list of the material available, or a set of summaries.

A literature review consists of an overview, a summary, and an evaluation (“critique”) of the current state of knowledge about a specific area of research. It may also include a discussion of methodological issues and suggestions for future research.

[6:22 pm, 07/02/2022] Faculty/Abdul Qadir/VIT: Your Review of Literature

1. Do I have a specific thesis, problem, or research question which my literature review helps to define?

2. What type of literature review am I conducting? Am I looking at issues of theory? methodology? policy? quantitative research (e.g., studies of neural pathways)? qualitative research (e.g., studies of loneliness among migrant workers)?

3. What is the scope of my literature review? What types of publications am I using (e.g., journals, books, government documents, popular media)? What disciplinary databases am I searching? (e.g., nursing, psychology, sociology, medicine)?

4. How good are my information-seeking skills? Has my search been wide enough to ensure I've found all the relevant material? Has it been narrow enough to exclude irrelevant material? Is the number of sources I've used appropriate for the length of my paper?

5. Is there a specific relationship between the literature I've chosen to review and the problem I've formulated?

6. Have I critically analyzed the literature I use? Do I just list and summarize authors and articles, or do I assess them? Do I discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the material I cite?

7. Have I cited and discussed studies contrary to my perspective?

8. Will the reader find my literature review relevant, appropriate, and useful
